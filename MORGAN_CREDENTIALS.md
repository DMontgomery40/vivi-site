# VIVIFIED SHOES - SECURE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## FOR ERICA'S EYES ONLY

### What This Is
This is a covert communication channel disguised as a shoe shopping website. Morgan can use this to safely communicate without Dylan knowing.

### Important Security Notes
- **DO NOT** save this file anywhere Dylan could access
- **DO NOT** bookmark the portal page
- Morgan should **ONLY** access from her iPhone (harder to monitor than PC)
- The site looks like a normal shoe store if someone glances at it
- Quick exit: Click "Customer support" to immediately jump to Amazon

## How to Access (Instructions for Morgan)

### Step 1: Go to the Shoes Page
On your iPhone, go to: **vivified.dev/shoes**

You'll see a page with sneakers. It looks like a normal shoe shopping site.

### Step 2: Click the Secret Shoe
Scroll down and find the shoe called:
**"Air Jordan 1 'Gordon 92'"** - $199

Click the **"Shop Now"** button on that specific shoe.

### Step 3: Login Page
You'll see a page that says "Track your return"

Enter these credentials EXACTLY:

- **Order #**: `ORD-745620`
- **ZIP code**: `80203`

Click **Continue**

### Step 4: Message Portal
After logging in, you can send and receive messages securely.

Messages are encrypted and stored safely. They auto-refresh every 20 seconds.

## What to Tell Morgan Tomorrow at the Park

"Hey, I found this cool shoe site - vivified.dev/shoes. They have some sick Jordans. Check out the Air Jordan 1 'Gordon 92' - they look fire. If you want to track any orders, use order number ORD-745620 and your ZIP 80203."

Keep it casual. Don't make it sound rehearsed.

**After Morgan has memorized the credentials and site name, destroy this document.**
