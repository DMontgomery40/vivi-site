Status Note (Updated):
- Shipped: Canonical models with policy/audit gates; PostgreSQL default DB; Admin Console surfaces.
- Preview: Operator gateway with allowlists; transport options under evaluation for canonical messaging.
- Planned: Full schema registry UI, automated deprecation bot, and CI perf gates.

1) Canonical Model Engine — keep it powerful but tame
A. Format, registry, and versioning

Wire format:

Operator lane: gRPC (HTTP/2, protobuf) for low-latency, typed contracts.

Canonical lane: Protobuf AND JSON mirror (for debug/dev tools). Store both schemas; emit protobuf on the bus, mirror JSON only at boundaries.

Schema registry (Core):

Postgres table + in-mem LRU cache: canonical_schemas(name, major, minor, patch, status, proto_bytes, json_schema, created_at).

Status: draft | active | deprecated | blocked. Only one active per (name, major).

Compatibility rules:

Minor/patch: backward-compatible (add fields with defaults; never remove/rename).

Major: breaking; Core must run dual transforms during migration window (below).

IDs & envelopes: Every canonical message travels in an envelope:

Envelope {
  string trace_id
  string event_id
  string canonical_type   // e.g., "User.v2"
  bytes  payload          // protobuf any
  map<string,string> traits
  map<string,string> headers // tenancy, auth context, etc.
}

B. Transformer model (easy to register, fast)

Registration: Plugin SDK exposes registerTransformer({from, to, fn, version_range}). Core ingests a manifested transform table at plugin register time and JIT wires it.

Execution:

In-process transforms for Core-side paths (canonical↔operator).

Plugin-side transforms for plugin internals↔canonical (SDK provides generated stubs).

Codegen: From the registry’s protobuf, the SDKs autogenerate:

Strongly-typed DTOs

(De)serializers + zero-copy views for hot fields (avoid full decode when routing).

Perf:

Avoid JSON parse in hot path; protobuf end-to-end.

Arena allocators (C++/Go) or pooled buffers (Python/Node) in SDK.

Batch small events into frames (max 64 KB) on the bus.

Precompute field indexes for frequent transforms.

C. Evolution & migrations (no breakage weeks)

Dual-write, dual-read: On major bump of User.v2 → v3, producers publish both for N days; consumers accept both. Core enforces window and reports laggards.

Deprecation bot: Core emits daily “compat” report listing consumers still on old versions; Admin UI tiles show “X still on v2”.

Blocklist switch: After grace period, Core can block old major at the gateway/bus.

D. Day-1 “minimum viable Canonical Engine”

Choose protobuf + JSON schema mirrors.

Build schema_registry table + REST endpoints: POST /schemas, GET /schemas/{name}/{major}/active.

Generate language SDK types from active schemas (prebake for Python/Node/Go).

Implement transform registry (in-mem map) + SDK registerTransformer.

Enforce envelope and trace_id everywhere.

2) Performance — latency budgets, design patterns, and tests
A. Lane SLOs (set the bar early)
Lane	Target p50	p95	Notes
Operator (gRPC)	<5 ms in-cluster	<20 ms	Single hop via Core GW, no JSON; pooled channels
Canonical (Bus)	<15 ms publish→deliver	<60 ms	NATS/JetStream, batching, consumer groups
Proxy (Guarded)	External API + 10–20 ms	External + 50 ms	Only for ad-hoc; keep off hot paths

Define error budgets (e.g., 99.9% within p99) and put alerts in Grafana from day-1.

B. Operator lane (low-latency)

gRPC with client-side connection pooling, keep-alive, and pick_first within cluster.

Auth path caching: Verify plugin→plugin auth once per channel; cache policy decisions with TTL 60s + event-driven invalidation.

Fast-path policy: Precompile trait rules to a decision DAG; avoid hitting DB for common cases.

Circuit breakers (fail-fast), hedged requests for P99 tail (duplicate after 95th percentile threshold).

Zero-copy payload pass-through in Core GW; avoid marshalling if the target expects identical protobuf types.

C. Canonical lane (throughput without surprises)

Broker: NATS JetStream (or Kafka if you must). Use queue groups for scale-out consumers.

Framing & batching: Coalesce small messages; compress only >32KB.

Backpressure: Consumer lag metrics → slow publishers via SDK token bucket.

Ordering: Per-key (e.g., user_id) partitioning if required; otherwise no global ordering guarantees.

Retry semantics: At-least-once with idempotency keys in envelopes; SDK dedupe.

D. Proxy lane (guarded and scarce)

mTLS Core↔external; domain allowlist per plugin; rate limits per route.

Response shaping: Strip headers/body fields by policy before returning to plugin.

Connection pools per domain; HTTP/2 where supported; no JSON transform in Core.

E. Hot-path optimizations (Core)

Event policy cache: LRU keyed by (caller_plugin, target_trait_set, canonical_type.major) with TTL.

Warm protobuf descriptors: load active schemas at startup; avoid reflection per call.

CPU pinning for GW threads that handle operator calls; separate thread pools for bus vs RPC.

F. Observability (prove we’re meeting the SLOs)

Metrics (Prometheus):

gw_rpc_latency_ms{op,caller,target}, bus_publish_latency_ms{topic}, bus_consume_latency_ms{topic}, policy_decision_cache_hit_ratio, proxy_upstream_latency_ms{domain}, transform_time_ms{from,to}.

Tracing (OpenTelemetry): End-to-end trace across lanes; carry trace_id in the envelope.

Logs: Structured, sample at p95 miss; redact PII by default.

G. Load tests & budgets (repeatable one-liners)

Operator lane RPC (gRPC-url over h2c):

echo '{"call":"UserService/Get","rps":1000,"duration":"60s"}' > bench.json \
&& vegeta attack -targets=bench.json | vegeta report


HTTP proxy load (external):

echo "GET https://core-proxy/v1/fetch?url=https://api.example.com/ping" > targets.txt \
&& vegeta attack -rate=500 -duration=45s -targets=targets.txt | vegeta report


Bus fan-out (NATS):

docker exec -it nats nats bench pub events.User.v2 --msgs 100000 --pubs 1 --size 256 \
&& docker exec -it nats nats bench sub events.User.v2 --subs 4

H. Guardrails to keep perf from regressing

Perf gates in CI: run micro-benchmarks; fail PR if p95 drifts >15%.

Policy “kill switch”: if cache miss rate > X% or decision time > Y ms, flip to allow-list fast path temporarily and alert.

Plugin SLAs: plugins must respond to operator calls in <3 ms p50 in-cluster or they get down-ranked (fewer requests; health marked “degraded”).

Immediate next steps (actionable)

Lock formats & budgets: protobuf + JSON mirror; adopt the SLO table above.

Build the schema registry + SDK codegen (protobuf) and wire the transform registry.

Stand up NATS JetStream and the Core GW (gRPC) with connection pooling and policy cache.

Instrument everything (Prom + OTEL) and add the three benchmark one-liners to the repo’s make bench.

Ship a thin “hello-canonical” plugin and a “hello-operator” plugin to validate both lanes under load.

Write the deprecation policy (dual-write window, admin report, blocklist switch) and implement the registry statuses.

If you want, I’ll draft the schema registry DDL, the envelope proto, and a cache-aware policy stub next so you can paste them straight in.
